	\section{How to Run the Project}

	The program is written in Python (version 3), and no compilation is required. To run the program, use the following calling convention:
	\\\\
	\texttt{./DecisionTree <options> <spec> <data>}
	\\\\
	If you receive a permissions error, you can run the following command to give the file executable permissions on your file system:
	\\\\
	\texttt{chmod 777 DecisionTree}
	\\\\
	Or alternatively run the program by calling:
	\\\\
	\texttt{python3 DecisionTree <options> <spec> <data>}
	\\\\
	Additionallly, calling the program with the \texttt{-h} flag will print a help page on the flags supported.

	\section{Summary of Implemented Work}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item All flags are supported (\texttt{d, md, pd, c, mc, pc}).
		\end{itemize}
